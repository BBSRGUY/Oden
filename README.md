# Oden
A bilingual Large Language Model

## Overview

ODEN (Odia-English Neural Reasoning System) is an advanced bilingual multimodal AI model with superior reasoning capabilities. It features a transformer-based architecture enhanced with Neural Turing Machine memory mechanisms, evolutionary learning strategies, and a novel optimization approach.

Key features:
- **Bilingual Support**: Seamlessly processes and generates text in both English and Odia
- **Neural Turing Machine Memory**: External memory module for enhanced reasoning and long-context understanding
- **Evolutionary Learning**: Self-optimizing architecture through neuroevolution techniques
- **Novelty Search**: Diversity-driven search to encourage robust reasoning pathways
- **Vector Database Integration**: Long-term knowledge retention via PostgreSQL with pgvector

## Model Variants

The ODEN architecture serves as the foundation for specialized models:

- **ODEN-C**: Optimized for coding and software development tasks
- **ODEN-D**: Specialized for data analysis and visualization
- **ODEN-M**: Enhanced for mathematical reasoning and problem-solving
- **ODEN-S**: Designed for scientific research and academic writing

## Architecture

ODEN implements a novel memory-augmented transformer architecture:

1. **Hybrid Tokenization**: Combines subword tokenization for both English and Odia
2. **Contextual Embeddings**: Language-aware embedding layer with positional encoding
3. **Memory-Augmented Transformer**: Transformer layers with NTM memory integration
4. **Vector Database**: Long-term knowledge storage using PostgreSQL with pgvector
5. **Evolutionary Optimization**: Self-improving architecture through neuroevolution
